# golang
first time building a webservice in GOlang

very basic http webservice that creates an in-meomory user database and can be found on port 3000.
Tested on LInux and windows10.

to test post json in this format:

{
    "FirstName": "joao",
    "LastName": "Bla2"
}

and check on users to find your entries. This is a blueprint only
